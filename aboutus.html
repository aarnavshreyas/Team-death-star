                Today, children spend a significant amount of time on cell phones, which can impact their academic performance and social growth. Social media applications, such as games, videos, and messaging apps, may initially seem entertaining but often become distractions, making studies more challenging. We believe that balanced face-to-face interaction is essential for developing key skills like communication, empathy, and teamwork.

                Our solution is an AI-powered time management application designed to promote better mobile usage among children. By leveraging machine learning, our application analyzes screen time, suggests study schedules, break times, and offline activities. It predicts optimal screen time based on each child's age, study habits, and emotional health, encouraging a healthy balance between digital engagement and personal growth.
